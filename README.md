**Wind Resource Temporal Variability:**

Wind resource varies highly across space and at different temporal scales, e.g., sub-hourly, diurnal, monthly, and annual. Understanding this variability is crucial for many wind energy modeling applications. The task for the interview is to develop a prototype analysis tool that examines wind speed variability at diurnal and monthly temporal scales at an individual location of your choosing. Use NRELâ€™s WIND Toolkit (WTK) data set to examine hourly (60-minute interval) wind speed data for the year 2012. Use only open-source tools. Develop statistical summaries and simple visualizations that will inform the user on the wind speed variability across diurnal and monthly scales. The solution should provide location-specific summaries but should also be developed in an extensible manner such that it could be scaled in the future to run efficiently across broad geographic extents (utilizing an HPC system or the cloud).
